# Project 1: Cybersecurity Foundations (Cisco)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my intensive study and practical analysis of the **Cisco Introduction to Cybersecurity** curriculum. This project marks the beginning of my foundational phase, where I build a deep understanding of the cyber landscape, threats, and defense mechanisms.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
* Understanding the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
* Analyzing modern attack vectors (Phishing, Social Engineering, Malware).
* Exploring how organizations protect their data and privacy.
* Understanding the legal and ethical aspects of cybersecurity.

## 📂 Project Modules
1.  **The Need for Cybersecurity:** Why security matters in the digital age.
2.  **Attacks, Concepts, and Techniques:** Analyzing how hackers think.
3.  **Protecting Your Data and Privacy:** Personal and organizational defense.
4.  **Protecting the Organization:** Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and security policies.
5.  **Will Your Future Be in Cybersecurity?:** Exploring industry roles and ethics.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
* **Risk Assessment:** Identifying vulnerabilities in digital environments.
* **Security Mindset:** Analyzing scenarios from both attacker and defender perspectives.
* **Documentation:** Clear and professional logging of technical concepts.

## 📑 Key Deliverables
* Detailed study notes for each module.
* Case study analysis for common cyberattacks.
* A final reflection on the current state of cybersecurity.
